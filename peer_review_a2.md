# Assignment 2: Review of programming report

Following the rubric, I evaluate the report as:

- ***Excellent***
  concerning completeness of concepts list.

- ***Excellent***
  concerning discussion of concepts: technical background.

- ***Excellent**
  concerning discussion of concepts: impact on implementation.

- ***Excellent***
  concerning clarity of program layout.

- ***Excellent***
  concerning resolution of subtasks.

To me, the resolution of subtasks seems a particular strong point of the report. It is thouroghly 
done and is easy to follow, with this implementation plan the assignment must have been carried out smoothly.

One aspect that I find could particularly help the group to improve their
implementation does not exist.
